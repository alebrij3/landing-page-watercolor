# Landing Page
This is my first landing page, it has mockup information; the objective was to use web technologies to create it.

## Technologies used
<div align="center">
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/61/HTML5_logo_and_wordmark.svg" width="200" height="auto" alt="html5 logo" />
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3d/CSS.3.svg" width="150" height="auto" alt="css3 logo" />
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/96/Sass_Logo_Color.svg" width="200" height="auto" alt="sass logo" />
</div>

### CSS Grid

The content of this landing page uses CSS Grid to align the elements.

### Flexbox

The menu uses flexbox because as a one-dimension element there was no reason to use CSS Grid here.

### Sass

The scss preprocessor was a plugin installed on VSCode, that's why there's no configuration or files related to CSS preprocessing.

### Responsive Design

This landing page is 100% responsive
